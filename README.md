Decision Helper

I was wanting to try out the new Vue3 composition api, and also weighing up some options at the moment, so why not a 'Pros and Cons' app.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
